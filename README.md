#Student Performance Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting student performance based on various academic and demographic factors. The project aims to analyze and predict students' success in their studies using different machine learning algorithms.

##Key Features:
###Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning, normalizing, and encoding the dataset.
###Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analyses to understand data patterns and correlations.
###Model Training: Implementation of various models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and more.
###Model Evaluation: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate the models.
###Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization techniques to improve model performance.
###Prediction: Making predictions on unseen data to estimate students' performance.
###Technologies Used:
##Python
##Scikit-learn
##Pandas
##Matplotlib/Seaborn
##Streamlit (for deployment)
